## 📈 Part 2 – Inventory Optimization with Excel

**Objective:** Anticipate stock requirements using EOQ, safety stock.

### 📐 Main Calculations:
- 🧮 **EOQ (Economic Order Quantity):** to minimize inventory and ordering costs
- 🛑 **Safety Stock:** based on maximum demand and lead time deviation
- 💰 **Total Costs:** sum of holding and ordering costs based on EOQ and stock levels

### 📂 Excel Tools:
- PivotTables for demand consolidation
- Custom formulas: `AVERAGE.IF`, `MAX.IF`, EOQ models, Safety Stock, Total Costs

- ### 🧾 Final Result:
