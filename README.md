## 📊 Part 1 – Performance Dashboard with Power BI

**Objective:** Build dynamic dashboards to analyze operational KPIs related to shipping, delivery delays, and lead times.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- 📍 **Lead Time Dashboard:** Highlights markets and products with the longest delivery times
- ❌ **Late Delivery Analysis:** On-Time Delivery (OTD) tracking, delay rates, and deviation metrics
- 📦 **Product & Shipping Mode Insights:** Identify top and problematic SKUs and logistics strategies
- 🗺️ **Market Performance View:** Interactive slicers for filtering by country, shipping mode, etc.

### 🛠 Tools & Skills:
- Power BI (DAX, calculated measures, interactive visuals, custom slicers)
- Data modeling and relationship management

## 📈 Part 2 – Inventory Optimization with Excel

**Objective:** Anticipate stock requirements using EOQ, safety stock.

### 📐 Main Calculations:
- 🧮 **EOQ (Economic Order Quantity):** to minimize inventory and ordering costs
- 🛑 **Safety Stock:** based on maximum demand and lead time deviation
- 💰 **Total Costs:** sum of holding and ordering costs based on EOQ and stock levels

### 📂 Excel Tools:
- PivotTables for demand consolidation
- Custom formulas: `AVERAGE.IF`, `MAX.IF`, EOQ models, Safety Stock, Total Costs

- ### 🧾 Final Result:
